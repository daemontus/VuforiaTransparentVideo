This sample application shows how to play a video in AR mode. Devices that

devices will play the video in full screen mode.

1. You need to print the stones and chips image targets to use this app.  These
images are available as part of the sample code package.

2. After you start the app, point the camera to the stones target image and a 
video frame will appear on top of the target.  

3. Tap the play button on the screen to start the video.
